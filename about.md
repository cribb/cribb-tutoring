## **About Me**

My name is Jeremy. I am a Ph.D. biomedical engineer and longtime student mentor. For more than twenty years, I designed custom microscopy and bioinstrumentation at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, where I generated multiple publications about biomaterials such as mucus and hyaluronan. During that time, I have mentored over a hundred students in an ever-active biophysics lab environment.

Now, I help high-schoolers conquer math and science with less stress and more confidence. I build understanding from first principles and teach students how to check their own work. Calm, organized, and invested in each student’s growth.
