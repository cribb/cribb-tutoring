# **Policies**

[Payment](#payment) • [Scheduling](#scheduling) • [Academic Integrity](#academic-integrity) • [Communication](#communication) • [Safety & Privacy](#safety--privacy)

### Payment
- **Payment is due immediately following each session.**
- I will invoice through the payment platform (Paypal/Venmo).
- Packages are prepaid and do not expire for 12 months.
- Unused package hours are **refundable** (at purchase price).
- Rate changes are announced **30 days** in advance; existing packages honor the rate at time of purchase.

### Scheduling
- Sessions by appointment (online or in **{{ site.area }}**).
- Regular weekly time is recommended; ad-hoc is fine when available.
- **24-hour notice** to reschedule or cancel without charge.
- No-shows or canceling with less than 24h → **bill 50%** of the session.
- If I must cancel, you are **never charged**; we’ll reschedule promptly.
- Lateness: I will wait **15 minutes**. After that, it counts as a no-show.
- Late arrivals still end at the scheduled time.

### Academic Integrity
- **I do not complete graded work for students.**
- I teach methods, provide examples, offer direction, and help students prep for assessments.

### Communication
- Quick email recap after each session (parents cc’d for minors).
- I reply to emails within **1 business day**.
- Families provide textbooks and/or course curriculum.
- I can supply practice sets and references.
- The pace and progress of sessions depends on constructive feedback from parent _and_ student. It's essential!

### Safety & Privacy
- **An inclusive environment is critically important, and all students deserve one that is respectful and supportive.**
- Online: Zoom or equivalent; families handle internet/device access.
- Session recording is not allowed without my consent
- In-Person: tutoring in public space (e.g., library, coffee shop) or in family spaces with parent/guardian present for minors.
- I reserve the right to end a session should I find the environment unsafe.
- I keep student information confidential and use it only for instruction and scheduling.
