# Policies

## Inclusivity
- All students are welcome. I maintain a respectful, supportive environment. 

## Scheduling
- Sessions by appointment (online or in **{{ site.area }}**).
- Regular weekly time is recommended; ad-hoc is fine when available.

## Rescheduling & Cancellations
- **24-hour notice** to reschedule or cancel without charge.
- <24h or no-show → **bill 50%** of the session.
- If I must cancel, you are **never charged**; we’ll reschedule promptly.

## Lateness
- I’ll wait **15 minutes**. After that, it may count as a no-show.
- Late arrivals still end at the scheduled time.

## Payment
- Due after each session (or weekly). Accepted: Paypal/Venmo.
- Packages are prepaid and **do not expire for 12 months.**

## Satisfaction
- First session: if you’re not happy, tell me the same day → **no charge**.
- Ongoing: I’ll adjust pace/materials on request.

## Communication & Recaps
- Quick email recap after each session (parents cc’d for minors).
- I reply to emails ASAP (usually within **1 business day**).

## Academic Integrity
- I do not complete graded work for students.
- I teach methods, provide examples, offer direction, and help students prep for assessments.

## Materials
- Families provide textbooks/curricula.
- I supply practice sets and references
- Share teacher syllabi or portals when possible for alignment.

## Online Safety & Tech
- Zoom or equivalent; families handle internet/device access.
- Recording sessions only with **mutual consent**.

## In-Person Safety
- Tutoring in public or family spaces with parent/guardian present for minors.
- I reserve the right to end a session if the environment is unsafe.

## Privacy
- I keep student information confidential and use it only for instruction and scheduling.

## Rate Changes
- Any rate change is announced **30 days** in advance; existing packages honor the purchase rate.

## Ending Services
- Either party may pause or end tutoring at any time; unused package hours are **refundable**.
